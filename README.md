Everyone needs a classic chocolate chip cookie recipe in their repertoire, and this is mine. It is seriously the Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Ever! I have been making these for many, many years and everyone who tries them agrees theyâ€™re out-of-this-world delicious!

Ingredients required:
 flour, 
 leavener,
 salt, 
 sugar,
 butter, 
 egg, & vanilla.
 Itâ€™s the ratios of those ingredients that make this recipe stand out from the rest.
  Mix 2 and 1/4  cups of flour with 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and my favorite: cornstarch.
  I use 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch in this recipe.

  RECIPE TIME !!

Use melted butter in this chocolate chip cookie recipe. Most of the cookies on my website call for creaming softened butter with the sugars. Chewy chocolate chip cookies require melted butter.

Since you are using melted butter, you donâ€™t need a mixer for this cookie recipe.

Use a mix of brown sugar and white granulated sugar in your chocolate chip cookies. I prefer more brown sugar than white granulated sugar because the moisture in brown sugar promises an extra soft and chewy baked cookie. White granulated sugar is still necessary though. Itâ€™s dry and helps the cookies spread. A little bit of spread is a good thing.

Another way to promise a super chewy chocolate chip cookie is to use an extra egg yolk. The extra egg yolk adds richness, soft tenderness, and binds the dough. You will need 1 egg and 1 egg yolk. You can freeze the extra egg white in a ziplock bag for up to 1 month or use it to make my Skinny Chocolate Peanut Butter Cupcakes. ðŸ™‚

The dough will be soft and the chocolate chunks may not stick because of the melted butter. Just keep stirring it; I promise it will come together.

The most important step is next.

Chilling the cookie dough is so important! Unless you want the cookies to spread into a massive cookie puddle, chilling the dough is mandatory for this cookie recipe. It allows the ingredients to settle together after the mixing stage but most importantly: cold dough results in thicker cookies. Cover the cookie dough and chill the dough for at least 2-3 hours and even up to 3-4 days. After chilling, let your cookie dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before rolling into balls.

After chilling, sometimes I roll the cookie dough into balls and freeze them in a large zipped-top bag. Then I bake them straight from the freezer, keeping them in the oven for an extra minute. This way you can have just one of two cookies whenever you want!

These cookies are hugeâ€“about 3 Tablespoons of dough is rolled to make one cookie. The batch only makes about 16 cookies since you will be rolling them so large. Feel free to make the cookies smaller (about 2 Tablespoons of dough per cookie) instead. If you do that, be sure to reduce the baking time by a couple minutes.the expected Choco Chip Cookie is ready!!
